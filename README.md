## Notes (As of January 27, 2021)

**WARNING**:  The CefSharp version isn't the latest one and might result potential security vulnerabilities, so please do not download and try the code.

I will be stop updating this until I found a way to edit and execute the source code. Since my actual PC died, I downloaded the lastest copy of source code from GitHub to edit the code in my virtual machine, but visual studio has the stupid copyright protection that automatically blocks you from running the file downloaded from the internet.
